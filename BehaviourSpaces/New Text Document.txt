Malaria Model Notes - 

Setting humans and mosquitoes inital values affected if the breeds would thrive or die out quickly.
If humans are set low and mosquitoes set high, the mosquitoes stand a chance of all dying out or thriving due to the 
bloodfeeding dependancy.

If all humans start to die out, all of the mosquitoes will die out as well as they require to bloodfeed to reproduce.

The further apart the malaria generation length and the replacement drug, the quicker the drug efficacy will reduce and 
make the human population die.

The more often the humans go to the hosptial to get drugs, the faster the drug efficacy reduces

At the begining if more people are visiting the hospital, the drug efficacy reduces slower than if less people where.
For example, if the hospital visit chance is set at 9 then at the begining the drug efficacy will reduce quicker than if 
the hospital visit chance is set to 92.
